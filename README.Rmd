The goal of `{gpt-template}` is to provide a template for gpt analyses
based on the `openai` package. The main purpose is to facilitate programmatically queries from textual column in a dataset.

## Usage

You can use this template by calling the following command in any R session:

``` r
# install.packages("usethis")
usethis::use_zip("CorradoLanera/gpt-template")
```

After everything is (automatically) downloaded, and (automatically) restarted following the instruction:

0. Close RStudio
1. Rename the downloaded folder and its inner .Rproj file, accordingly to your project requirements (use the same name for both).
2. Move the folder to the desired location.
3. Put your data inside the `data-raw/` folder.
4. Open the project in RStudio.
5. Run, and accept, `renv::restore()` to install the required packages.
6. Open the `analyses.R` script to start your analyses; inside you will find the template and a commented example to start from.
